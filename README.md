# Data Steward (Local)

Data Steward (local) is a program designed to help you manage your file system. It does this by leveraging LLMs to "understand" what a file is, it's contents, and provide suggestions as to where it should go. It builds out an [embedding system, knowledge graph]? to track how files are related to each other.

(Local) refers to how this application is designed to be local first. By default it uses Ollama, and [ChromaDB, FAISS, QDrant]
